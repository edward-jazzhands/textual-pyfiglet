Base package - includes 11 fonts (41kb):   
`pip install textual-pyfiglet`

Install with extended fonts collection - 519 fonts (1.6mb):   
`pip install textual-pyfiglet[fonts]`   

------------------------------------------

Textual-PyFiglet is an implementation of [PyFiglet](https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet) for [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).

It provides a `FigletWidget` which is designed to be easy to use, and blend in with how Textual works.

## Key features


### Textual-PyFiglet is a fork of PyFiglet:

   The original PyFiglet has zero dependencies, since it's a full re-write of FIGlet in Python. Thus by forking, Textual-PyFiglet also has zero dependencies (aside from Textual of course). PyFiglet is bundled inside as a sub-package.

   I made sure to preserve the full git history of PyFiglet, as well as its original CLI and demo (see Demo Program below).

### Greatly minimized:

   PyFiglet wheel: **1.1 MB**.  -->   Textual-PyFiglet wheel: **41 KB**.

   99% of the size of PyFiglet is just the massive fonts collection, 519 in total. In the base textual-pyfiglet package I've included only 11 of the best minimal fonts. I've also made it very easy to download the full collection for those who still want it (use extended fonts install, shown at the top)

### Widget easily drops into your Textual app:

   The widget is based on `Static` and is designed to mimick its behavior. That means it can drop-in replace any Static widget, and it should just work without even adding or changing arguments (using default font). Assuming you're accounting for the size of the text somehow.

   It achieves this by simply overriding the `update()` method in Static. When update is called, PyFiglet will convert the input text, and PyFiglet's output is passed to `self.renderable`. So it should drop in nicely if you have any Static widgets that are using these attributes.

   By default, the FigletWidget will automatically set its own size when it updates. (width and height are set to auto). But, **it will also respect any container or widget it's inside of, and wrap the text accordingly.**

   Note that **this behavior can be toggled**. By default it will wrap on resize, but this can be turned off, in which case it will crop.

### Real-time updating:

   It's easy to make ASCII text that real-time reflects text input.

   This real-time updating feature can be seen in the included demo, as well as the OG online generator:   
   https://patorjk.com/software/taag/

   For instance, if using a TextArea widget to enter text, simply update the FigletWidget with each keystroke:

   ```python
   @on(TextArea.Changed)
   def text_changed(self):
      text = self.query_one("#text_input").text
      self.query_one("#figlet").update(text)
   ```
   PyFiglet is more than fast enough to handle this.

### Extended fonts collection moved to separate package:

   If you want the whole collection, simply use:   
   `pip install textual-pyfiglet[fonts]`

   You can install the whole thing straight from that command, or use it to add the fonts to an existing install. The fonts package is about 1.5 MB (compressed). Hey, when you're making CLI tools, being light-weight matters. That's why the extended collection has been made optional - Now you decide if you need it.

   The included 11 fonts I hand-picked were chosen for being small, minimalist, and professional looking. For people that don't want to think about fonts, these 11 will probably be all you need.

   You can also easily add more fonts by just downloading individual font files the oldschool way, and plopping them in the fonts folder (inside the Pyfiglet folder, which will be in /lib/python/site-packages/textual-pyfiglet)

   A good website to download individual fonts:
   http://www.jave.de/figlet/fonts/overview.html

   Note: If you download the extended fonts pack, the first time you run textual-pyfiglet, it will need a few seconds to copy all of the fonts. It will only do this one time.

### Demo program included

   Run the demo program with either:   
   `textual-pyfiglet`   
   Or:   
   `python -m textual_pyfiglet`

   PyFiglet also has its own CLI which has been kept available. (Which has its own built-in demo program.) You can access the PyFiglet CLI with:   
   `python -m textual_pyfiglet.pyfiglet`

   Try it out to see the options. For instance, try running this code:   
   `python -m textual_pyfiglet.pyfiglet Hey guys, whats up?`

FIGlet fonts have existed for a long time. There's a bunch of good generators on the internet. Just google "figlet online".
Several of those were very helpful for me so big thanks to anyone that has made a FIGlet generator of some kind.

And finally, thanks to the many hundreds of people that contributed to the fonts collection.
