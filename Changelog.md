# Textual-Pyfiglet Changelog

## 0.10.0 (2025-07-24)

- Potentially Breaking Change: Updated to the new Rich-Pyfiglet 0.2.0. This new version is no longer a fork of Pyfiglet, but instead uses the Pyfiglet library as a dependency (My essential changes got merged back upstream, so having a fork is no longer necessary! Major win). Things should mostly work as expected, but there may be some minor API changes or fonts that are no longer there. This can potentially break some apps that were using the old Rich-Pyfiglet API, but I have tried to keep the changes minimal.

## 0.9.2 (2025-06-22)

- Updated to use the new ColorOMatic 0.2.0. Everything works as expected and there should be no breaking or API changes.
- Refactored the demo code slightly to be more similar to the ColorOMatic demo. Nested all CSS in demo/styles.tcss to improve readability.

## 0.9.1 (2025-06-22)

- Changed the ColorOMatic dependency version from >=0.1.4 to ==0.1.4. This was done because the ColorOMatic underwent a major overhaul and internal refactor, and I need to ensure that the FigletWidget is compatible with the new ColorOMatic before I allow it to use the new version.

## 0.9.0 - Color-O-Matic major split update (2025-06-15)

- The color and animation system was split off to its own package. Textual-Pyfiglet now uses Textual-Color-O-Matic as a dependency. This has reduced the amount of code in the Figletwidget.py module from over 800 lines (including all comments/blank lines) to just under 400. The API remains exactly the same and there should be no breaking changes.
- The demo app was refactored to be a subpackage split into several files for significantly better readability (Also matches the same demo structure as the Color-O-Matic package).

## 0.8.6 (2025-06-10)

- Fixed typo in pyproject.toml locking textual-slidecontainer to 0.4.0

## 0.8.5 (2025-06-06)

- Fixed bug where some small fonts caused a division by zero error
- Updated the project to use the new rich-pyfiglet 0.1.4, which uses the new type hints added into Pyfiglet, making all of the type: ignore statements no longer necessary and thus were removed.

## 0.8.4 (2025-05-22)

- Improved some docstrings to reflect new features, added a docstring for FigletWidget.fonts_list

## 0.8.3 (2025-05-22)

- Added ability to detect textual CSS theme variables ($primary, $secondary, $panel, etc) which are passed in to the color list.
- Added detection for app theme changes, so if you have a CSS theme variable passed in to the color list, it will automatically change to match the new theme. This allows for dynamically-colored widgets which will change their color to match the current theme.
- The animate button in the demo will now be disabled whenever there's less than 2 colors in the color list.

## 0.8.2 (2025-05-22)

- Fixed bug when initializing the widget with 2 or more colors in the list.
- Fixed bug when initializing the widget with only 1 color and setting animate to true.

## 0.8.0 (2025-05-15)

Enhanced the color and animation system in several ways:

- BREAKING CHANGE - The color system has been upgraded to using a list that can take any number of colors instead of using variables color1 and color2. As such, color1 and color2 have been removed. There is now only the `colors` constructor parameter and corresponding `color_list` variable. This now matches the rich_pyfiglet library (which also takes colors as a list). If you were passing color1 and color2 in to the constructor, simply modify your app to pass them both in as a list. The set_color1 and set_color2 methods were likewise replaced with a single set_color_list method. (You can set the reactive directly, but since it is a list you would also need to use the mutate_reactive method in Textual.)
- BREAKING CHANGE - The `animation_speed` parameter was changed to `fps` and correspoding `animation_fps` reactive. It also had an 'auto' mode added to it. This number is still a float, but existing code will need to be slightly modified. FPS is more intuitive and matches the rich_pyfiglet library's API. When in auto mode, it will use 12 FPS for gradient animation, 8 FPS for smooth_strobe, and it will drop to 1 fps if the animation type is changed to 'fast_strobe'.
- Added `animation_type` argument and corresponding reactive attribute of the same name. Can now choose between gradient, smooth_strobe, and fast_strobe. Note that smooth_strobe and fast_strobe will ignore the horizontal bool (they don't have a direction). Added a corresponding `set_animation_type` method to go along with the new animation_type attribute.
- Addded `horizontal` argument and corresponding reactive attribute. This bool will make the gradient render horizontally instead of vertically. In auto mode it will adjust to the length of the widget.
- Added `reverse` argument and corresponding reactive attribute. This bool will make the running animation go in reverse. For vertical gradients this toggles between up and down. For horizontal gradients this toggles between left and right. With the strobe effects, this will make the colors run in the reverse order.
- Enhanced the demo to show all these new settings.

## 0.7.0 - The major split update (2025-05-13)

- Pyfiglet was removed as a subpackage, and moved over to the newly created Rich-Pyfiglet library. Rich-Pyfiglet is now a dependency of Textual-Pyfiglet and provides the Pyfiglet fork.
- Re-worked much of the API and public facing methods. Made it much easier to modify most of the reactives directly. Added docstrings to all the public reactives.
- Added validation methods to most of the reactives (using Textual's built in reactive validators).
- Gradients in 'auto' mode will now automatically re-calculate when the widget's height changes.
- If one of the colors is removed while animating, it will now stop the animation internally.
- Enhanced type hinting: Package now passes MyPy and Pyright in strict mode.
- Added py.typed file to mark package as typed for Pyright/MyPy.
- Added a small example.py file into the package.
- Colors passed in are now only parsed one time by the validator method, because its an expensive call.
- Several small bug fixes in demo app.
- Added Ruff, Black, and MyPy to project dev dependencies, and set all of them to run automatically using the justfile before publishing.

## 0.6.0 - The Animation update (2025-04-22)

- Color, gradient, and animation modes have been added. There are 5 new arguments in the constructor:
  - color1
  - color2
  - animate: Boolean to toggle on/off
  - animation_quality: Auto mode uses the figlet height by default.
  - animation_interval: Speed in seconds as a float.
- The fonts list is now a string literal collection to give auto-complete. Choosing a font is now much easier.
- The full fonts collection is now included by default. Deleted the extended fonts package from PyPI. This should also solve any issues with PyInstaller or other packaging tools.
- Much of the widget was re-written from the ground up to switch to using the LineAPI.
- Platformdirs has been removed as a dependency. (Now there's no dependencies.)
- Completely revamped the demo. Added Textual-Slidecontainer for the menu bar. Also added new options to show off the color and animation features.
- Changed package manager and build system from Poetry to uv
- Converted Makefile into Justfile
- Deleted config.py and other code related to managing the fonts (no longer needed).
- Removed Inner/Outer architecture, decided it was overcomplicating things. Converted it to one large class.
- Added a help section for the demo.
- Added a `figlet_quick` class method onto FigletWidget which is a bridge to `pyfiglet.figlet_format`
